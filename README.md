## Customer Segmentation & Recommendation System – ML Project

---

### Objective  
To analyze retail customer purchasing behavior and develop a machine learning–driven system that enables customer segmentation and personalized product recommendations to support targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.

---

### Dataset  
Retail transactional dataset containing customer-level and transaction-level information such as invoices, product descriptions, quantities, unit prices, and purchase timestamps. The dataset reflects real-world purchasing behavior, including repeat transactions and product returns.

---

### Models Used  
-K-Means Clustering – Customer segmentation based on behavioral patterns

-User–User Collaborative Filtering – Personalized recommendations using customer similarity

-Hybrid Recommendation Model – Combination of personalization and cluster-level popularity

---

### Techniques  
- RFM-based feature engineering (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

- Log transformation and RobustScaler for handling skewed data and outliers

- Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, Davies–Bouldin Index, Calinski–Harabasz Index

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization

- Cosine Similarity for user-based recommendation logic


---

### Key Insights  
Loyal and high-value customers contribute the largest share of revenue

At-risk customers show low engagement and long inactivity periods

Hybrid recommendations improve relevance and stability across all segments
